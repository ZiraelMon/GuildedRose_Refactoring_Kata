# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

## Test Strategy

Our testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all business rules and edge cases:
   - Standard item degradation
   - Special items (Aged Brie, Sulfuras, Backstage passes)
   - Quality boundaries (never negative, never above 50)
   - SellIn date effects
   - Multiple items processing

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Clear naming convention
   - Each test follows Arrange/Act/Assert pattern
   - Use of TestCase attribute for parameterized testing
   - Focused tests that verify one behavior at a time

3. **Test Data**:
   - Meaningful test data that represents real scenarios
   - Edge cases and boundary values
   - Combinations of different items

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring focused on the following improvements:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - Separated item updating logic into specific methods
   - Each method handles one type of item or one aspect of the update

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Constants for magic strings and numbers
   - Private helper methods for specific functionality
   - Clear method names that describe their purpose

3. **Maintainability Improvements**:
   - Eliminated nested if statements
   - Used switch statement for different item types
   - Separated quality boundary checks
   - Reduced code duplication

4. **Key Changes**:
   - Created UpdateSingleItem method to handle individual items
   - Separated SellIn and Quality updates
   - Created specific methods for each special item type
   - Added quality range validation

5. **Main improvements summarized**:
   - Easier to understand and maintain
   - Easier to modify or extend
   - More reliable with clear boundaries
   - Better organized with logical separation of concerns
